== Quest link ==

Hi there!

I have NEVER EVER published info to a WIKI site and dont want to mess anything up so thought I would post a comment.

I was thinking about rearranging the Quest page to show quests by Chapter vs Alphabetically. Or maybe do both? Provide links from the main selection page to direct folks to which format they need.

If anyone would be willing to mentor a WIKI newb I would love to help update content.

mike~

  <text>Were these extracted or are these screenshots?  If they are extracted, why am I blind and cannot find their .dds files anywhere?  Are they .tga?

: They are extracted, I can't remember the exact key file these were from because I just extracted all the files with your BIF extractor. They are originally DDS files, in the dds folder. Try all the key/bif files, you'll find them... :-) --[[User:Jean seb|Jean seb]] 22:08, 19 November 2007 (UTC)

Anyone know a guide/walkthrough that'll tell you how to obtain ALL the cards...? 

Correct me if I'm wrong, but aren't there 30 cards? not 24?

== nudity? ==

am i missing something? the cards i have gotten in game are more...politically correct then half the cards i see online...seems like i got the "PG" version of this game regardless of the mature warning...am i missing something?

  <text>The layout I've started using on the location pages is to have the journal image at the top and to the right, a bit smaller than full-size, and have the text flow around it:

This is of course open to discussion.

  <text>== Variable stats? ==

While editing some weapon pages, I noticed that craftable weapons seem to have semi-random stats.  At first I thought it was a bug when the stats didn't match the crafting diagram, but three copies of the same sword made by the same character each had slightly different Damage ratings and Effect percentages.

The same may also be true for pre-existing items. The stats listed here for Stennis' Sword were different from the version in my game (which I thought was an error and edited). [[User:Bring back Shani|Bring back Shani]] 09:28, June 3, 2011 (UTC)</text>

  <text>One major issue I found with the compilation table of the items is the lack of ability to arrange the table by chapter they can be first found in. I'd try to correct that omission if not for my tendency to screw up any formatting I try to work with :) [[Special:Contributions/66.234.47.205|66.234.47.205]] 17:34, October 4, 2011 (UTC)
:We have fairly severe space restrictions given wikia's fixed width. There are chapter specific categories you could look at for items. Feel free to leave a list of all the items you've found, where you found them and in which chapter on this page — [[User:Game widow|Game widow]] <sup><small>([[User_talk:Game widow|talk]])</small></sup> 00:19, October 5, 2011 (UTC)

::: Perhaps duplication of the tables would help? The currently shown information seems geared toward loot carrying (price and weight), which in itself is also important.

::: However, I would suggest that a table showing availability and allowing comparison of items according to their useability (meaning armor rating for armor pieces - as already included, and damage range for weapons, as well as information about the chapter each item is first encountered in) be more pertinent to an average viewer. Perhaps I am mistaken, but I haven't really bothered looking up the "loot factors" since I'm playing a version with storage implemented and (with Strong Back) keep carry capacity sufficient to haul everything I find.

::: On the other hand, being able to check what equipment choices I have would be extremely helpful (and for that reason I keep mentioning the Chapter field). I'm not really into running every other moment to craft or obtain "improved" equipment, so I try to find the best gear for a given part of the game and upgrade it either through quest rewards, or when I know for certain the upgraded version will last for a while.

::: Admittedly, others may have different playing style, though I do believe the useability factor to be of greater interest than loot information.

::: My chipped oren. ;) [[Special:Contributions/66.234.47.205|66.234.47.205]] 01:12, October 6, 2011 (UTC)

::: Ugh, as usual forgot - I could not find either sword or armor category that would have the chapter availability in a table. Could you drop a link if it exists? I do have a tendency to overlook the obvious... Thanks in advance :) [[Special:Contributions/66.234.47.205|66.234.47.205]] 01:17, October 6, 2011 (UTC)

::::I think Game widow was suggesting that you refer to the chapter specific categories such as Category:The Witcher 2 Prologue, Category:The Witcher 2 Chapter I, etc. to assist in compiling lists of information you would like to see added to the tables, not that those categories already contained the information in table form. Any effort you can contribute is a bit less work for other people, and likely to reduce the time it will take to update the tables.

== Lost item?Glitch? ==

Um.. hi. Have never bothered to edit wikis before but recently found an object in witcher 2 Enhanced edition and cannot seem to find any info on it, 

Diagram: Draug trap .

Trap. Effective against the Draug.

Components required 

2x Iron ore

2x silver ore

1x essence of death

this is my 2nd playthrough on Dark difficulty but first time seeing this item,appears that it may not be a normal item because the icon is a bluey reddish rainbow lookin thingy lol.

  <text>== Censorship of this section ==

This section seems to have been censored by Wikia's staff...

Quite ironic as the purpose of the romance cards pages is to show the difference between the censored and uncensored versions of the game.

Does someone still have the pictures originally used on this page ? It would be a pity to have content removed from this wiki just because of some prudish staff member.





Here all cards  http://witcherbr.tumblr.com/post/66714662163/todas-as-sex-cards-do-the-witcher-1-versoes-com  just reupload them.



For what reason? All cards are on official CD Projekt wiki. Copying them here isn't needed.


It is even [http://community.wikia.com/wiki/Thread:758769 '''not allowed''' to upload them] - Wikia will always delete those stuff because of wikia's ruleset. There have been already [http://forums.cdprojektred.com/threads/17065-The-Official-Witcher-Wiki-has-moved several discussions] about this. One of the effects is that now we have two witcher wikis.
